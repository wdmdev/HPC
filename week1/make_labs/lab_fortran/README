Make and Makefiles - exercise 4
-------------------------------

Use the files in this directory to check, if the version of make you
are calling supports Fortran 90 source files (suffix .f90).  If it does,
you are lucky, and done!

If make fails, extend the suffix list and write a new rule to be able
to compile the project with make.

Hint: use 'make -p' and check the compilation rules for .f files!  Take 
those as a starting point to add your own rules to the Makefile, to
accomplish the task.
